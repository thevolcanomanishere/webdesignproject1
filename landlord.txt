<p><h2>Landlord and Tenant</h2></p>

The preparation and negotiation of a Lease of property in the modern world is a complicated and</br>
difficult process. Decisions made today which may seem insignificant now could have extensive and</br>
far reaching effects in the future. No Lease should be entered into either by Landlord or Tenant</br> 
without the benefit of Legal Advise and at Patrick W. McGonagle & Co we can provide the necessary</br>
advise and support to ensure that you are fully informed before you enter into such a commitment.</br>
