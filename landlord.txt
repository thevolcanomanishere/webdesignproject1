<p><h2>Landlord and Tenant</h2></p>

<p>The preparation and negotiation of a Lease of property in the modern world is a complicated and
difficult process. Decisions made today which may seem insignificant now could have extensive and
far reaching effects in the future. No Lease should be entered into either by Landlord or Tenant 
without the benefit of Legal Advise and at Patrick W. McGonagle & Co we can provide the necessary
advise and support to ensure that you are fully informed before you enter into such a commitment.</p>
