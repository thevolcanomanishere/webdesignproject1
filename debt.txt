absolute priority for owners and managers.</p>

<p>We have in excess of 30 years experience in the recovery of Debt, and provide an efficient and</br>
speedy service. We ensure that all clients are kept fully informed of all stages of the process and</br>
appreciate clients may not be familiar with the procedures and processes of debt recovery. To</br>
assist clients we have set out the following three step procedure:</p>

<p><li>Step 1  Demand Letter We recommend to clients that an initial 7 day demand letter is sent</br>
immediately to the debtor seeking the payment of the outstanding debt. This 7 day demand</br>
letter will set out our intentions to issue legal proceedings if the debtor fails to discharge</br>
the outstanding account.</br></li>
<li>Step 2  Issuing of Legal Proceedings If the debtor fails to respond to the 7 day demand letter</br>
legal proceedings can be issued and served on the debtor. If the debtor fails to discharge the </br>
amount due and the costs of the proceedings we can then make an application for Judgment</br>
against the debtor.</br></li>
<li>Step 3  Enforcement Once Judgment has been obtained against the debtor the we can seek to</br>
enforce the Judgment in various ways and we will discuss all of these options with you.</br></li></p>
