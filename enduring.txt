<p><h2>Enduring Powers of Attorney</h2></p>

<p>In Ireland if, and individual becomes mentally incapacitated as a result of illness or accident, no</br>
family member or loved one can have access to your assets and property without an Executed</br>
Enduring Power of Attorney or unless you become a Ward of Court.</br></p>

<p>An Enduring Power of Attorney is a legal document which allows you to appoint someone of your</br>
choice to control your affairs, should you become mentally incapacitated. Your current personal</br>
situation is not affected by the creation of an Ensuring Power of Attorney.</br></p>

<p>The Enduring Power of Attorney can only come into effect if you become mentally incapacitated</br>
and only then when it has been registered by your Solicitor in the High Court on foot of a doctors</br>
report as to your mental incapacity and provided notification has been given to your two selected</br>
notice parties. The notice parties will be given an opportunity to object to the registration of the</br>
Enduring Power of Attorney.</br></p>

<p>The Enduring Power of Attorney can be revoked by you at any time up to the date of registration.</br>
It can be revoked after registration but only by way of an application to the Court.</br></p>

<p>The execution of an Enduring Power of Attorney is an easy and practical way for an Individual to</br>
protect their assets, property and future requirements.</br></p>

<p><h2>Wards of Court</h2></p>

<p>In Ireland, there are two categories of Wards. The first and the larger category comprises of</br>
Individuals over 18 years of age who become mentally incapacitated as a result of illness or</br>
accident, being made a Ward of Court. The principal purpose of making an Individual a Ward of</br>
Court is to protect and manage the assets and property of the Ward for the benefit of any of</br>
his/her dependents (if any).</br></p>

<p>To be made a Ward of Court the President of the High Court has to be satisfied with the Medical</br>
evidence presented to him that the Individual is not capable of managing his own affair and is of</br>
unsound mind.</br></p>

<p>The Ward Ship can be revoked by a Ward by way of an application to the President of the High</br>
Court to show that the Ward is now of Sound Mind, capable of managing his own affairs and the</br>
application should be supported by Medical evidence.</br></p>
