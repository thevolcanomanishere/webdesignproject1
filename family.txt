<p><h2>Family Law</h2></p>

Family Law is a very complex area and no two cases are the same. At Patrick W. McGonagle & Co,</br>
our solicitors are available to provide you expert advice where a marriage or relationship has</br>
broken down irretrievably or is on the verge of a breakdown.

We advise our clients in a practical manner, set out clearly the options available to them, whilst</br>
considering the financial, taxation, succession and welfare issues involved. We aim to get our clients</br>
the best and fairest results possible through active negotiations and mediation between the parties.</br>
Where this does not prove possible we vigorously pursue Separation, Divorce and other related</br>
Family Law Proceedings through the Irish Courts.</br>
