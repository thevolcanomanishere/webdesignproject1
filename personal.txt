<p><h2>Personal Injury</h2></p>

<p>Prior to commencing Court Proceedings in Ireland claimants must comply with the provisions of </br>
The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act, 2003. This Act provides that anyone intending to </br>
seek compensation for a Personal Injury (other than a Personal Injury arising out of Medical</br>
Negligence) must make an application to the InjuriesBoard.ie</br></p>

<p>The InjuriesBoard.ie handles personal injuries claims relating to motor accidents, accidents in</br>
the workplace and claims involving public liability.</br></p>

<p>The time frame in which to issue a claim for compensation is two years from the date of accident,</br>
failure to comply with the time frame will result in your case becoming statute barred. There are</br>
exceptions to this time frame, where persons are under 18 years of age and some other </br>
categories however we would advise you to submit your claim within the said two years to avoid</br>
disappointment.</br></p>

<p>The InjuriesBoard.ie have recommended that you notify the respondent/s (the person/s whom the</br>
claim is being made against) in writing of your intention to bring a claim for compensation for</br>
personal injuries sustained within two months from the date of accident.</br></p>

<p>The InjuriesBoard.ie have set out a precise procedure which must be followed when submitting a</br>
claim for compensation. The Solicitors and Support Staff at Patrick W. McGonagle & Co would be</br>
most delighted to meet you to discuss the practice and procedures involved in submitting a claim to</br>
the InjuriesBoard.ie. Should the need ever arise please contact either Patrick W. McGonagle or</br>
