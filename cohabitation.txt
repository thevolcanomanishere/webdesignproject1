<p><h2>Co-Habitation Agreements</h2></p>

<p>The joint ownership of property is not simply a matter of registering two names. The rights and</br>
obligations of parties in these transactions can be complicated and are best served by preparing</br>
and signing Joint Ownership/Co-Habitation Agreement at the time of purchase of the property. We</br>
can provide all necessary advise in the preparation and completion of these documents.</br></p>

<p>With the advent of The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</br>
there are now certain rights and obligations imposed upon Co-Habitating couples irrespective of the</br>
intention of the parties. We can advise you and assist you in deciding how best to deal with the</br>
provisions of this Act and whether or not you should enter into an Opt Out Agreement.</br></p>
